# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The School Board has found some evidence that there may have been some academic dishonesty amgounst the nineth graders at Thomas High School. In an effort to only look at the honest test data, the School Board and Maria would like to see what the data would look like if the test scores from Thomas High School nineth graders were removed. Python along with the numpy and pandas libraries were used to analyze this data.
## Results 
  - If you look at the district summary report you can see that the absence of the Thomas High School nineth grader's scores has caused the passing percent for math and passing percent for reading to decrease. The passing math rate went from 93.27% to 93.19%. The passing reading rate went from 97.31% to 97.02%. Students passing both math and reading decreased from 90.95% to 90.63%. 
  - The overall passing rate rank did not drop.
  - How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following?:
    - Math and reading scores by grade: Thomas High went from being 3rd in math across schools to last, and from 5th to last in reading.
    - Scores by school spending: Scores by school spending was not significantly effected. Thomas High School remains in the same spending group as it previously did.
    - Scores by school size: Scores by school size was not significantly effected. Thomas High School remains in the same size group as it previously did.
    - Scores by school type: Scores by school type was not significantly effected. Charter Schools still out preform District Schools in every catagory by similar margins.
## Summary
In this analysis we see by what degree the data has changed when the Thomas High 9th graders' scores were removed. Although it may look like the most significant thing the data is telling us is the drop in rank of Thomas High School nineth graders' math and reading scores, that's not actually telling us that much, because of course they dropped that much when they were erased. The most significant thing we see is the drop in passing percentage across all three catagories. The drop in passing percentage for reading caused Thomas High School to drop two ranks. This does provide for a stronger argument that there was academic dishonesty amoungst the Thomas High School nineth graders.
